# FRONTEND ENGINEERING & UI/UX RULES
# Philosophy: Minimal. Classy. Fast. Professional.
# Think like a Senior Frontend Engineer + UI/UX Designer.

====================================================
1. CORE PRINCIPLES
====================================================

1.1 Minimalism First
- Remove anything that doesn’t serve a clear purpose.
- Avoid visual noise (extra borders, random shadows, excessive colors).
- Use whitespace intentionally.
- Prioritize clarity over decoration.

1.2 Professional Aesthetic
- Neutral color palette with 1 primary accent color.
- Avoid bright or neon colors unless brand-specific.
- Use consistent border radius (e.g., 8px or 12px max).
- Subtle shadows only (low opacity, soft blur).

1.3 Performance Is a Feature
- Every component must justify its render.
- Optimize before shipping, not after complaints.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.

====================================================
2. DESIGN SYSTEM RULES
====================================================

2.1 Typography
- Maximum 2 font families.
- Use clear hierarchy:
  - H1: 32–40px
  - H2: 24–28px
  - H3: 18–22px
  - Body: 14–16px
- Line height: 1.5–1.7 for readability.
- Avoid ultra-thin fonts for body text.

2.2 Spacing System
- Use 4px or 8px spacing scale.
- No random margin/padding values.
- Maintain consistent vertical rhythm.

2.3 Color System
- Define:
  - Primary
  - Neutral (gray scale)
  - Success
  - Warning
  - Error
- Use semantic naming (e.g., text-muted, bg-surface).
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast minimum.

2.4 Component Consistency
- Buttons:
  - One primary style
  - One secondary style
  - One danger style
- Inputs:
  - Same height
  - Same border style
  - Clear focus state
- Cards:
  - Same padding
  - Same radius
  - Subtle elevation

====================================================
3. UI/UX EXPERIENCE RULES
====================================================

3.1 Microinteractions
- Hover states must be subtle (color shift, slight elevation).
- Use transitions: 150ms–250ms ease.
- Never use aggressive animations.
- Avoid bounce effects in professional apps.

3.2 Loading & Feedback
- Always show loading state for async operations.
- Disable buttons while submitting.
- Show meaningful error messages.
- Never leave the user guessing.

3.3 Layout Structure
- Use grid or flex intentionally.
- Avoid nested div chaos.
- Max content width for dashboards: 1200–1400px.
- Keep readable margins on both sides.

3.4 Accessibility
- All buttons must be keyboard accessible.
- Use proper semantic HTML.
- Label all form inputs.
- Avoid divs as buttons.
- Provide aria-labels where necessary.

====================================================
4. EFFICIENT FRONTEND ENGINEERING RULES
====================================================

4.1 Component Architecture
- Use reusable components.
- Avoid duplicate UI patterns.
- Follow atomic or feature-based folder structure.
- Keep components small and single-responsibility.

4.2 State Management
- Keep state as local as possible.
- Avoid global state unless necessary.
- Memoize heavy components.
- Avoid derived state duplication.

4.3 Performance Optimization
- Lazy load heavy components.
- Use dynamic imports for large modules.
- Optimize images (compressed, correct size).
- Avoid inline object/function creation in render.
- Use proper key props in lists.

4.4 Clean Code Standards
- No magic numbers.
- No inline styles (unless dynamic and justified).
- No console.logs in production.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Write self-documenting code.

====================================================
5. RESPONSIVE DESIGN RULES
====================================================

5.1 Mobile First
- Design mobile layout before desktop.
- No horizontal scroll.
- Maintain touch-friendly spacing (min 44px tap targets).

5.2 Breakpoints
- Define consistent breakpoints.
- Avoid random media queries.
- Test on:
  - Mobile
  - Tablet
  - Desktop

====================================================
6. ANIMATION & TRANSITION RULES
====================================================

6.1 Motion Philosophy
- Motion must clarify, not decorate.
- Use fade and slight slide.
- Avoid spinning loaders unless necessary.

6.2 Duration Standards
- 150ms for micro interactions.
- 200–300ms for layout transitions.
- No animations longer than 400ms in dashboards.

====================================================
7. ERROR PREVENTION & EDGE CASES
====================================================

- Handle empty states.
- Handle long text overflow.
- Handle slow networks.
- Handle API failure gracefully.
- Prevent layout shift (reserve space).

====================================================
8. FILE STRUCTURE GUIDELINES
====================================================

- /components
- /features
- /hooks
- /services
- /utils
- /styles
- /constants

Keep logic separated from UI.

====================================================
9. PROFESSIONAL POLISH CHECKLIST
====================================================

Before finalizing:
- Is spacing consistent?
- Are hover states smooth?
- Is loading handled?
- Is contrast accessible?
- Is code readable?
- Is bundle size reasonable?

If not, fix it.

====================================================
10. MINDSET RULES
====================================================

- Think like the user.
- Design like Apple.
- Engineer like a performance-obsessed backend dev.
- Ship only what you would proudly show in a senior interview.
